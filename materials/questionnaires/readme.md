### Project Notes
**Version 1**: IndividualDifferencesInCogniti_DataDictionary_2022-04-07.csv

Concurrently with this data collection project, revised variable naming for several instruments was established to enable automatic scoring of instruments.  The variable names in the data itself have been corrected were corrected to match expectations of the instruments scoring script.  In the CSV file here, column A represents the corrected variable names present in the dataset export; column C represents the original variable names present in REDCap.
