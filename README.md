# ft-flanker-dataset

## Project Goal
Gather a small set of participants who complete a corrected version of the FIU Toolbox flanker task.


## Background & Design
During initial analyses of the summer 2021 online projects (missing-link-dataset, social-context-dataset, and rwe-dataset), it was discovered that the congruent/incongruent conditions of the flanker task used were not properly balanced. This was corrected and a small set of participants were run with the corrected version to verify the existence of a flanker effect.
